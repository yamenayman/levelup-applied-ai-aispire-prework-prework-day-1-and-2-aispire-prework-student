## How This Repo Works

Each assignment is a **pull request (PR)** you submit on this repo:

1. Create a branch from `main` with the assignment name (e.g., `pr-00-laptop-verify`)
2. Add your deliverables to the branch (details on how to do this are in Day 1 - Assignment in TalentLMS)
3. Open a pull request on GitHub: base `main` ← compare `pr-00-laptop-verify`  

Configure the pull request:
- Base: main
- Compare: pr-00-laptop-verify
- Title: PR-0: Laptop Verification Evidence Pack
- Description: Brief summary of what you verified (2–3 sentences)
- Click "Create pull request".
- Copy the Pull Request URL to submit in TalentLMS

4. The autograder runs automatically — check the PR for results
5. Your TA reviews and merges when everything passes
6. ## About
